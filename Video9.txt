Size and flow can be affected by pen pressure.
Alpha changes the shape of the brush tip. The alphas for the presets are substance files.
Tangent is painting in 3D space. The brush orientation will align to the meshes tangent.
Camera Projection works best when the view port is looking flat at the face.
UV allows you to paint without having seams. But this is not always good. You can also make it stay on one UV.
If you change the brush size to view port the size of the brush changes with the zoom of the viewport.
