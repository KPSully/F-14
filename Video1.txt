The first video talks about PBR. PBR is a method of shading that takes into account how light hits surfaces.
Substance Painter is a tool that creates PBR map types and exports BMPs for use with PBR shaders such as Unity.
PBR is based on real world measured data. It also allows for consistent materials.
PBR has 2 main workflows, Metallic/Roughness and Specular/Glossiness. Both use the same accurate physical data.
Metallic has three core maps: base color and metal reflectance, metal map, and dielectric(nonmetal).
Roughness is how much of the light has been broken up. Dielectric shaders automatically use 4% reflectance.
