In the fourth video, he talks about texture sets. A texture set is a material. You can import these through the model file.
You can apply full materials through the smart materials. You can hide certain materials, or even solo one material.
You can add channels to each material that are specific to the texture sets.
By default, Substance painter will only display the selected material. You can change this by going to Edit>settings>and change the material solo to false.
You can change resolution at any time. This is not just an upscale, it is recomputed and is completely accurate. You can then export them at that resolution.
