In the thirteenth video, he talks about using the projection tool.
The projection tool can be found at the top bar.
This allows you to project a material onto a mesh. The projection tool is used with a full material. The stencil tool is used as a secondary screen space mask.
Material mode will give a popup of all the materials in the shelf.
You can control the opacity.
You project color, height, roughness, metal, and ambient occlusion all at the same time.
If you hold down the S key and the right mouse button, you can scale the projection.
If you hold down the S key and the left mouse button, you can rotate.
If you hold down the S key and the middle mouse button, you can pan.
