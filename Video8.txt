In the eighth video, he talks about materials and channels.
By default, you have base channels base color, Height, Roughness, and Metalic.
You can interactively change the roughness. You can disable the height information.
You can select a material and paint with it, but you are painting across all channels.
The colors determine the artributes of the material. You can work with any number of channels at the same time.
You don't have to paint all channels, you can just paint the information you want.
You can fix seams by switching to planar projection.
