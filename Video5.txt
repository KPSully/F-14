In the fifth video, he discusses baking textures. Bake textures is available for all materials in the projects.
When you bake a texture it is applied to the texture set map.
You can select the bake texture option to pull up a menu. In the menu, there are the type of maps that you can bake.
These maps are specific to the generator. All anchors are enabled by default, and have parameters both as a whol and individually.
When you are not using a cage mesh, you should use the frontal and rear distance setting to create a virtual envelope. The rays are then shot from the envelope.
If you you set average normals off, you can make the virtual envelope not continuous.
How one knows how to set the frontal and rear distance values is just trial and error.
The world base normal has no parameters
Ambient occlusion has a quality control to remove noise.
ID baker makes a mask that is used for baking.
You can use colors to make a mask selection by using the mask to color selection.
