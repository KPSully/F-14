In the tenth video, he discusses particle brushes.
Particle brush presets0 work similar brush presets.
Particle brushes have controls for the particle physics.
You start with one of the presets and modify the settings.
If you want the particles to fall further down the mesh, you need to increase the particle life.
Gravity factor makes the particles fall quicker. Gravity factor can also cause wind. Wind can be used to push the particles in different directions along the x and y axes.
Distance time, is how long between each particle.
Particles won't just coillide with the mesh geometry but will also take the normal map into account.
