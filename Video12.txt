In the twelfth video, he talks about using generators and filters.
Rather than painting on a mask, you can use a generator. Generators can only be applied to a mask.
You can interactively modify the settings of a generator. Every generator has image inputs.
All the baked data will be automatically used when a generator is applied.
You can combine two generators with a blending mode. With the paint effect, you can paint in and out the effects. 
Set the blending mode to multiply, this allows you to modify the effect stack.
Filters can process the generators before they reach the mask.
